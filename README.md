# Internship Projects

This repository contains the tasks I completed during my internship at **Elitetech Pvt Ltd**. 
These projects gave me hands-on experience with Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and NLP techniques. Below is a list of the key projects I worked on.

## 1.Decision Tree Classification
Implemented a Decision Tree model using `scikit-learn` to classify data into categories based on input features.

**Highlights:**
- Used Gini and Entropy as splitting criteria.
- Visualized the tree structure to understand decision paths.
- Evaluated performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## 2.Sentiment Analysis
Built a Natural Language Processing pipeline to classify text data (e.g., reviews) into **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral** sentiments.

**Highlights:**
- Preprocessing: tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization.
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF vectorizer.
- Trained models using Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression.

## 3.Image Classification
Developed an image classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images into different categories.

**Highlights:**
- Used Keras with TensorFlow backend.
- Applied data augmentation to improve model generalization.
- Trained and evaluated on datasets like MNIST or CIFAR-10.

## 4.Recommendation System
Created a recommendation system using Collaborative Filtering and Matrix Factorization techniques.

**Highlights:**
- Built user-item interaction matrix.
- Predicted unknown ratings and generated top-N recommendations.
- Evaluated using RMSE and precision@k.
